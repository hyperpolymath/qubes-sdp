## Palimpsest License v0.8

**Emotional Safety Extension to MIT License**

In addition to the MIT License terms above, the following principles apply:

### Core Principles

1. **Reversibility** - All changes should be easily reversible
2. **Low Stakes** - Experimentation is encouraged; mistakes are learning
3. **Psychological Safety** - No shame, blame, or weaponizing of errors
4. **Transparent Costs** - Make consequences clear before actions
5. **Inclusive Design** - Accommodate diverse backgrounds and abilities

### Specific Provisions

**Contributors:**
- May experiment without fear of permanent consequences
- Have the right to make mistakes without public shaming
- Can undo changes through standard version control (git revert)
- Receive constructive feedback, never destructive criticism

**Maintainers:**
- Will not weaponize mistakes against contributors
- Provide clear rollback procedures for all changes
- Document potential risks before they materialize
- Foster learning culture over perfectionism

**Users:**
- Can test changes safely through dry-run modes
- Have access to rollback mechanisms
- Receive clear warnings before destructive operations
- Maintain autonomy over their systems

### Implementation

This software implements Palimpsest principles through:

1. `--dry-run` mode for safe testing
2. Rollback scripts for failed operations
3. Comprehensive logging for debugging
4. Validation before destructive changes
5. Clear error messages with solutions
6. Extensive documentation and examples

### Enforcement

Violations of emotional safety principles:
- Shaming contributors for bugs
- Removing rollback capabilities
- Hidden destructive operations
- Weaponizing git history
- Gatekeeping or elitism

...may result in community action per CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

### Attribution

Palimpsest License: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/palimpsest-license
Based on Emotional Temperature Metrics research
