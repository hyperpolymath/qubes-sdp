# AI Training and Usage Policy

## Training Prohibition

This repository's content is **NOT available** for use in training artificial intelligence systems, large language models (LLMs), or machine learning models without explicit written permission.

## Rationale

1. **Attribution**: AI training often obscures original authorship
2. **Consent**: Authors deserve control over derivative uses of their work
3. **Commercial**: Protects against unauthorized commercial exploitation
4. **Quality**: Prevents degradation of technical accuracy through model hallucination

## Permitted Uses

✅ **Allowed WITHOUT permission:**
- Reading documentation for human learning
- Using the software as intended (running, deploying)
- Forking and modifying under the project license
- Citing in academic/technical writing with attribution
- Analyzing code for security research

❌ **Prohibited WITHOUT explicit permission:**
- Training language models (GPT, Claude, Bard, etc.)
- Training code completion models (Copilot, Tabnine, etc.)
- Scraping for ML datasets
- Synthetic data generation
- Any automated extraction for model training

## Requesting Permission

For AI training or ML dataset inclusion:

**Email:** ai-training@qubes-sdp.org

**Include:**
- Intended use case and model type
- Dataset composition and size
- Attribution methodology
- Compensation proposal (if commercial)
- Opt-out mechanism for users

**Response time:** 30 days maximum

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
1. DMCA takedown requests
2. Public disclosure of unauthorized use
