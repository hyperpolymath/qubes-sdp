# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* **Recognizing and respecting emotional safety** as fundamental to productive collaboration
* **Assuming good intent** and seeking clarification before making accusations
* **Celebrating experimentation** and learning from failures without blame

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* **Weaponizing mistakes** against contributors
* **Gate-keeping** or dismissing newcomers' contributions
* **Deliberate stress-inducing** communication patterns
* **Invalidating others' experiences** or emotions

## Emotional Safety

Beyond traditional conduct standards, we recognize **emotional safety** as critical to community health:

### We Value

* **Psychological safety** - Freedom to experiment without fear of humiliation
* **Reversibility** - Ability to undo mistakes easily (git revert, rollback, etc.)
* **Gentle feedback** - Constructive criticism without personal attacks
* **Learning culture** - Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failings
* **Inclusive language** - Avoiding jargon that excludes newcomers
* **Transparent processes** - Clear contribution pathways reduce anxiety

### We Avoid

* **Perfectionism** - Demanding flawless contributions from the start
* **Time pressure** - Arbitrary deadlines that induce stress
* **Public shaming** - Calling out mistakes in humiliating ways
* **Imposter syndrome triggers** - "This is obvious", "Everyone knows", etc.
* **Gatekeeping** - "You should already know this"
* **Scope creep** - Demanding endless revisions beyond original scope

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

This project operates under TPCF **Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)**:

### What This Means

* **Open Contribution** - All contributions welcome, regardless of employer
* **Community Governance** - Decisions made through consensus or maintainer discretion
* **No Corporate Control** - Project independence from any single organization
* **Meritocracy** - Contributions judged on technical merit and community value
* **Transparency** - Decisions explained publicly

### Contribution Expectations

* **Be patient** - Maintainers are volunteers with limited time
* **Be thorough** - Include tests, documentation, and clear commit messages
* **Be respectful** - Follow this Code of Conduct
* **Be collaborative** - Work with maintainers, don't demand acceptance
* **Be understanding** - Not all contributions fit project scope

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** conduct@qubes-sdp.org

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

Reports will be kept confidential. Details may be shared only with:

* Other maintainers (to assess and respond)
* Legal authorities (if required by law)
* The accused (only facts necessary for their response)

**We will never:**

* Publicly disclose reporter identity without consent
* Retaliate against good-faith reporters
* Share reports with the reporter's employer
* Use reports for purposes beyond community safety

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
