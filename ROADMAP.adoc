== Contributing to the Roadmap

This is a *TPCF Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)* project. All contributions to roadmap items are welcome.

=== How to Contribute

. *Pick an item* from the roadmap or propose a new one
. *Discuss* in GitHub Issues before major work
. *Fork, implement, test* - use dry-run modes extensively
. *Submit PR* with documentation updates

=== Prioritization Criteria

Features are prioritized based on:

* *Security impact* - Does it improve the security posture?
* *User demand* - How many users are requesting it?

=== Non-Goals

The following are explicitly out of scope:

* GUI desktop environment changes beyond Qubes integration
* Non-Qubes OS support
* Proprietary software dependencies
* Features requiring network access from vault
* Complexity that compromises security
